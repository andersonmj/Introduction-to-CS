# Introduction-to-CS

These exercises are taken from the course of Introduction to Computer Science in Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101). This course teaches the basics of Python 2 while doing a "big project" which is a web crawler. Between the pieces of code that we put together for the crawler in each lesson, I find some interesting and challenging problems in quizzes or homeworks that are saved here as well.
